                <p><strong>Where are you from</strong></p>
                <p>Hailing from the incredible land of spices and chai, I blossomed amidst the waves and sandcastles of a little coastal charmer called Bapatla. 🏖️</p>

                <p><strong>IT Interest</strong></p>
                <p>I proudly don the hat of a web magician, conjuring interactive wonders on the digital stage. Java application development, my enchanting sidekick, joins me in this tech tango. Together, we're the dynamic duo crafting bytes with a dash of code comedy! 🕸️☕</p>

                <p><strong>First Computing Device</strong></p>
                <p>Embarking on my digital journey, I kicked off with a trusty companion: an Intel i3-powered desktop computer(2010). It's like my tech-savvy sidekick, helping me conquer coding quests while occasionally sipping on some virtual coffee! ☕💻</p>

                <p><strong>Something Interesting About You</strong></p>
                <p>I've got a knack for throwing shindigs that even party-planning gurus envy. If event organizing were an Olympic sport, I'd be the gold medalist, and when it comes to trip planning, I turn ordinary vacations into epic escapades that even GPS systems applaud! 🎉✈️</p>
